.HSH(1)                Shell Project                .HSH(1)

NAME
       hsh - UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       hsh

DESCRIPTION
       hsh is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that allows you to execute commands and perform basic shell operations. It provides a prompt for the user to enter commands, executes the commands, and displays the results. The prompt is displayed again after each command execution.

USAGE
       hsh

COMMAND LINE SYNTAX
       hsh supports the following command line syntax:

       command [arguments]

       Each command line ends with a new line.

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
       hsh implements the following built-in commands:

       exit [status]
              Exits the shell. If an optional status is provided, the shell exits with that status. Behaves similarly to the exit command in sh.

       cd [path]
              Changes the current directory of the shell process. If no argument is given, it changes to the home directory ($HOME). Supports the command cd - to switch to the previous directory. Updates the PWD environment variable accordingly.

       env    Prints the current environment variables.

ERROR HANDLING
       hsh handles errors in the following ways:

       - If an executable command cannot be found, an error message is displayed, and the prompt is displayed again.
       - hsh handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D) gracefully.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       hsh handles and parses the PATH environment variable to find executables.
